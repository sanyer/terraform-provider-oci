# Data Source: oci_mysql_replicas
This data source provides the list of Replicas in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure MySQL Database service.

Lists all the read replicas that match the specified filters.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_mysql_replicas" "test_replicas" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	configuration_id = oci_mysql_mysql_configuration.test_mysql_configuration.id
	db_system_id = oci_mysql_mysql_db_system.test_mysql_db_system.id
	display_name = var.replica_display_name
	is_up_to_date = var.replica_is_up_to_date
	replica_id = oci_mysql_replica.test_replica.id
	state = var.replica_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `configuration_id` - (Optional) The requested Configuration instance.
* `db_system_id` - (Optional) The DB System [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only the resource matching the given display name exactly.
* `is_up_to_date` - (Optional) Filter instances if they are using the latest revision of the Configuration they are associated with. 
* `replica_id` - (Optional) The read replica [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `state` - (Optional) The LifecycleState of the read replica.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `replicas` - The list of replicas.

### Replica Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `availability_domain` - The name of the Availability Domain the read replica is located in.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the read replica.
* `configuration_id` - The OCID of the Configuration currently in use by the read replica.
* `db_system_id` - The OCID of the DB System the read replica is associated with.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - User provided description of the read replica.
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the read replica. It does not have to be unique.
* `encrypt_data` - Encrypt data details. 
	* `key_generation_type` - Select whether to use Oracle-managed key (SYSTEM) or your own key (BYOK).
	* `key_id` - The OCID of the key to use.
* `fault_domain` - The name of the Fault Domain the read replica is located in.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the read replica.
* `ip_address` - The IP address the read replica is configured to listen on. 
* `is_delete_protected` - Specifies whether the read replica can be deleted. Set to true to prevent deletion, false (default) to allow. Note that if a read replica is delete protected it also prevents the entire DB System from being deleted. If the DB System is delete protected, read replicas can still be deleted individually if they are not delete  protected themselves. 
* `lifecycle_details` - A message describing the state of the read replica.
* `mysql_version` - The MySQL version currently in use by the read replica.
* `nsg_ids` - Network Security Group OCIDs used for the VNIC attachment.
* `port` - The port the read replica is configured to listen on.
* `port_x` - The TCP network port on which X Plugin listens for connections. This is the X Plugin equivalent of port. 
* `replica_overrides` - By default a read replica inherits the MySQL version, shape, and configuration of the source DB system.  If you want to override any of these, provide values in the properties, mysqlVersion, shapeName,  and configurationId. If you set a property value to "", then the value is inherited from its  source DB system. 
	* `configuration_id` - The OCID of the Configuration to be used by the read replica.
	* `mysql_version` - The MySQL version to be used by the read replica.
	* `nsg_ids` - Network Security Group OCIDs used for the VNIC attachment.
	* `shape_name` - The shape to be used by the read replica. The shape determines the resources allocated:  CPU cores and memory for VM shapes, CPU cores, memory and storage for non-VM (bare metal) shapes.  To get a list of shapes, use the [ListShapes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/mysql/20190415/ShapeSummary/ListShapes) operation. 
* `secure_connections` - Secure connection configuration details. 
	* `certificate_generation_type` - Select whether to use MySQL Database Service-managed certificate (SYSTEM) or your own certificate (BYOC). 
	* `certificate_id` - The OCID of the certificate to use.
* `shape_name` - The shape currently in use by the read replica. The shape determines the resources allocated:  CPU cores and memory for VM shapes, CPU cores, memory and storage for non-VM (bare metal) shapes.  To get a list of shapes, use the [ListShapes](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/mysql/20190415/ShapeSummary/ListShapes) operation. 
* `state` - The state of the read replica.
* `time_created` - The date and time the read replica was created, as described by [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339). 
* `time_updated` - The time the read replica was last updated, as described by [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339).
