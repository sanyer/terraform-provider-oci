# Data Source: oci_database_db_homes
This data source provides the list of Db Homes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Lists the Database Homes in the specified DB system and compartment. A Database Home is a directory where Oracle Database software is installed.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_db_homes" "test_db_homes" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	backup_id = oci_database_backup.test_backup.id
	db_system_id = oci_database_db_system.test_db_system.id
	db_version {
	}
	display_name = var.db_home_display_name
	state = var.db_home_state
	vm_cluster_id = oci_database_vm_cluster.test_vm_cluster.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `backup_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the backup. Specify a backupId to list only the DB systems or DB homes that support creating a database using this backup in this compartment.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `db_system_id` - (Applicable when source=DATABASE | DB_BACKUP | NONE) The DB system [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm). If provided, filters the results to the set of database versions which are supported for the DB system.
* `db_version` - (Applicable when source=NONE | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) A filter to return only DB Homes that match the specified dbVersion.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given. The match is not case sensitive.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state exactly.
* `vm_cluster_id` - (Applicable when source=VM_CLUSTER_BACKUP | VM_CLUSTER_NEW) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster.
